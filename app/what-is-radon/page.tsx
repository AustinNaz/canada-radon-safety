          Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that forms from the decay of uranium in soil, rock, and water. <strong>It is colorless, odorless, and tasteless</strong>,
          making it undetectable withou specialized testing. Radon is part of the environment and can be found almost everywhere, but it becomes a concern when it accumulates to high levels indoors, particularly in enclosed spaces like homes, schools, and workplaces.
